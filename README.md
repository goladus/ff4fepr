## FFIV Free Enterprise Post-Randomizer

This tool is designed to make additional modifications and randomizations to a seed generated by [Final Fantasy IV - Free Enterprise](http://ff4fe.com), a fantastic "open world randomizer" romhack for Final Fantasy IV, by B0ardface.

### Current Status

Ff4fepr is currently focused on implementing python libraries for extracting data from and modifing the Final Fantasy IV/Free Enterprise ROM.  Although much of this is replicating PinkPuff's work on ff4kster, that tool is designed as a manual editor and doesn't work with Free Enterprise.  This is intended to be a programmatic one, with feature more suitable to making a variety of large-scale changes based on rules and logic, which is what most randomizers do.  The included command-line tool is primarily developed for proof-of-concept and testing libraries, though it is still usable to make modifications and randomizations to Free Enterprise rom files.

The API, such as it is, is still entirely in flux, largely undocumented and subject to change.

### Warning about Cheating

Please note that this tool is (currently) intended only for casual and experimental use.  Because this tool scans and can reveal randomized information about the game, using it on a Free Enterprise race rom before or during a league race or any other official FF4FE race on SpeedRunsLive is considered cheating and will result in disqualification and a ban from SRL.

### Why a "Post-Randomizer"?

Final Fantasy IV Free Enterprise is a truly excellent romhack, and is notable as much for what it doesn't do as what it does.  FF4FE has a distinct vision and mission.  It is an open world hack designed for speedrunning and racing.  While fixing bugs and making occasional tweaks here and there, ff4fe is very disciplined and deliberately preserves vanilla behavior whenever possible.  The original FF4 has a great deal of depth and Free Enterprise really enables that depth to shine through while keeping the hack familiar and accessible to players who loved the original game.  FF4FE is also highly polished, with many of great and subtle quality-of-life features.

All that said, some players are interested in more reckless or crazy modifications that aren't appropriate for FF4FE's disciplined approach.  These ideas may include rebalancing weaker characters like Edward and Dark Knight Cecil, or difficulty hacks such as randomizing the cast times on all spells.  Other ideas may just be a lower priority.  My hope is that this tool can at least somewhat address this desire, even if it's ultimately only in a casual fashion.

### Using ff4fepr

Currently, this tool has no official distribution mechanism.  It's developed for Python 2.7 and has been tested on [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) (but uses minimal libraries so probably works in any POSIX environment).  To use this on windows without Cygwin, you'll need to set up a batch file or powershell script that passes `ff4fe-post-randomizer` to `python.exe`.  It will look something like this:

```
.\Scripts\python.exe .\Scripts\ff4fe-post-randomizer %*
```

`ff4fe-post-randomizer -h`
```

Final Fantasy 4 Free Enterprise Post-Randomizer

This tool dumps information or makes modifications to a specified smc file.
